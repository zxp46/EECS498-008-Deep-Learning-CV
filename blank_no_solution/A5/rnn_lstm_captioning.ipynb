    "# COCO Captions\n",

The dataset consists of 80,000 training images and 40,000 validation images, each annotated with 5 captions written by workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have preprocessed the data for you already and saved them into a serialized data file. It contains 10,000 image-caption pairs for training and 500 for testing. The images have been downsampled to 112x112 for computation efficiency and captions are tokenized and numericalized, clamped to 15 words. You can download the file named `coco.pt` (378MB) with the link below and run some useful stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will later use RegNet-X 400MF model to extract features for the images. A few notes on the caption preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with strings is inefficient, so we will work with an encoded version of the captions. Each word is assigned an integer ID, allowing us to represent a caption by a sequence of integers. The mapping between integer IDs and words is saved in an entry named `vocab` (both `idx_to_token` and `token_to_idx`), and we use the function `decode_captions` from `a5_helper.py` to convert tensors of integer IDs back into strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple special tokens that we add to the vocabulary. We prepend a special `<START>` token and append an `<END>` token to the beginning and end of each caption respectively. Rare words are replaced with a special `<UNK>` token (for \"unknown\"). In addition, since we want to train with minibatches containing captions of different lengths, we pad short captions with a special `<NULL>` token after the `<END>` token and don't compute loss or gradient for `<NULL>` tokens. Since they are a bit of a pain, we have taken care of all implementation details around special tokens for you."

    "# Image Captioning with LSTMs\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have implemented a vanilla RNN and applied it to image captioning.\n",
    "Next we will implement LSTM and use it for image captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LSTM** stands for [Long-Short Term Memory Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory), a variant of vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
    "Vanilla RNNs can be tough to train on long sequences due to vanishing and exploding gradients caused by repeated matrix multiplication.\n",
    "LSTMs solve this problem by replacing the simple update rule of the vanilla RNN with a gating mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LSTM Update Rule:** Similar to the vanilla RNN, at each timestep we receive an input $x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^D$ and the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$; the LSTM also maintains an $H$-dimensional *cell state*, so we also receive the previous cell state $c_{t-1}\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$. The learnable parameters of the LSTM are an *input-to-hidden* matrix $W_x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H\\times D}$, a *hidden-to-hidden* matrix $W_h\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H\\times H}$ and a *bias vector* $b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each timestep we first compute an *activation vector* $a\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4H}$ as $a=W_xx_t + W_hh_{t-1}+b$. We then divide this into four vectors $a_i,a_f,a_o,a_g\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$ where $a_i$ consists of the first $H$ elements of $a$, $a_f$ is the next $H$ elements of $a$, etc. We then compute the *input gate* $g\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$, *forget gate* $f\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$, *output gate* $o\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$ and *block input* $g\\in\\mathbb{R}^H$ as\n",

    "g = \\tanh(a_g)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function and $\\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent, both applied elementwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we compute the next cell state $c_t$ and next hidden state $h_t$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "where $\\odot$ is the elementwise product of vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the notebook we will implement the LSTM update rule and apply it to the image captioning task.\n",
    "In the code, we assume that data is stored in batches so that $X_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times D}$, and will work with *transposed* versions of the parameters: $W_x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times 4H}$, $W_h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\times 4H}$ so that activations $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 4H}$ can be computed efficiently as $A = X_t W_x + H_{t-1} W_h$"

    "\n",
    "To get the attention input $x_{attn}^t$, here we adopt a method called `scaled dot-product attention`, as covered in the lecture. We first project the CNN feature activation from $\\mathbb{R}^{400\\times4\\times4}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{H\\times4\\times4}$ using an affine layer. Given the projected activation $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\times4\\times4}$ and the LSTM hidden state from the previous time step $h_{t-1}$, we formuate the attention weights on $A$ at time step $t$ as $M_{attn}^t=h_{t-1}A/\\sqrt{H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4\\times4}$.\n",

    "We add a **`softmax`** activation function on $\\tilde{M^t}_{attn}$ so that the attention weights at each time step are normalized and sum up to one.\n",
